182004,"[Ticket #1] During the development of the 'SkyBound' project, an unexpected challenge arose involving 'Alembic cache not importing'. This issue was initially discovered during routine asset reviews and has since manifested in various scenarios. Artists noted irregular behaviors such as system slowdowns, unresponsive UI elements, and in some cases, crashes during peak usage hours. A preliminary investigation ruled out hardware failures, leading us to suspect a possible software bug or compatibility glitch with existing pipeline tools. We conducted tests using a clean scene and isolated scripts, yet the anomaly persisted. Documentation related to 'Alembic cache not importing' was consulted, and feedback from fellow team members suggested that the problem may be rooted in Maya's internal handling of certain operations. We strongly recommend a deep dive into logs, GPU diagnostics, and environment variables to determine any patterns. The problem has become a bottleneck, delaying outputs from both the animation and lighting departments. Proposed fixes include script-level overrides or patching Maya preferences, but a scalable solution is required. A step-by-step replication procedure and affected scene files are available for inspection. Given its scope and disruption, this issue is prioritized as critical and demands immediate attention.",James Baker,Emily Perkins,SkyBound,Yet to Start,1736035200,4

183990,"[Ticket #1987] During the development of the 'JungleRun' project, an unexpected challenge arose involving 'Outliner duplication bug'. This issue was initially discovered during routine asset reviews and has since manifested in various scenarios. Artists noted irregular behaviors such as system slowdowns, unresponsive UI elements, and in some cases, crashes during peak usage hours. A preliminary investigation ruled out hardware failures, leading us to suspect a possible software bug or compatibility glitch with existing pipeline tools. We conducted tests using a clean scene and isolated scripts, yet the anomaly persisted. Documentation related to 'Outliner duplication bug' was consulted, and feedback from fellow team members suggested that the problem may be rooted in Maya's internal handling of certain operations. We strongly recommend a deep dive into logs, GPU diagnostics, and environment variables to determine any patterns. The problem has become a bottleneck, delaying outputs from both the animation and lighting departments.
